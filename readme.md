## Introduction

This tutorial breaks down the internal logic of two particular steps in a GitHub Actions workflow: the “Set env” and “Patch version” steps. By understanding these steps, you will gain insight into how version numbers are handled, set, and utilized to ensure consistent project versioning in the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## Set env Step Explanation

In the “Set env” step, a GitHub Action fetches the most recent release's version number and sets it as an environment variable (`RELEASE_VERSION`). The script uses the GitHub CLI to list the releases, extract version numbers, and format them for use in subsequent steps.

For a detailed breakdown, please refer to the [Set env Step Explanation section](#set-env-step-explanation) in the main tutorial content.

## Patch Version Step Explanation

The “Patch version” step in the workflow is tasked with updating the `package.json` file with the latest version number fetched in the “Set env” step. It then commits this change to a new branch formatted as `release/v${RELEASE_VERSION}`. This step is crucial for ensuring the `package.json` file accurately reflects the current project version.

For a detailed explanation, please refer to the [Patch Version Step Explanation section](#patch-version-step-explanation) in the main tutorial content.

## Conclusion

Understanding the “Set env” and “Patch version” steps in a GitHub Actions workflow is crucial for successful and consistent project versioning and releasing. This tutorial provides a clear and detailed breakdown of these steps to enhance your understanding and management of GitHub Actions workflows.
